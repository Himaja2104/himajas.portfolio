                <p> Before going to digital wireframes, I roughed out ideas and layouts that I had on paper. This phase let me test a number of ideas at once and also decide on the final outline of the text. Sketching also helped to identify potential usability issues early, which is important for the next steps of a digital design phase.</p>
